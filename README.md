# automatethethings
 A Python-centric project to work through "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python," among other things that I cook up or need.
 
### /src
* **hello_world.py:** A simple "Hello World" process

* **FTP_KeepAlive.py:** A KeepAlive process I use to keep my powerline ethernet adapaters awake by pushing a local file to an FTP server and pulling it back down
